# Cupertino

Cupertino is a theme for the Mozilla Firefox browser designed to match the macOS color scheme and design. It provides a slightly more native look and feel for Firefox on Mac computers, inspired by the design of Apple Safari and the [Mozilla Protocol color scheme](https://protocol.mozilla.org/docs/fundamentals/color). Cupertino supports both light and dark modes.
